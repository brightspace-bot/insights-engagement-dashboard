## Developing, Testing and Contributing

After cloning the repo, run `npm install` to install dependencies.

#### Releasing and Versioning

To make a release, update the version number in package.json and
make a release in github. BSI and LMS changes will be handled by
automation (master branch only: release branches of the LMS
have to be handled manually).

This repo uses the following versioning scheme for both package.json
and release tags:
- major: always 1, so BSI automatically picks up every update
- minor: the minor and patch LMS version with zero-padding; e.g. 2012 for 2020 December, 2101 for the January release, etc.
- patch: increment as needed

### Running the demos

To start an [es-dev-server](https://open-wc.org/developing/es-dev-server.html) that hosts the demo page and tests:

```shell
npm start
```

### Linting

```shell
# eslint and lit-analyzer
npm run lint

# eslint only
npm run lint:eslint

# lit-analyzer only
npm run lint:lit
```

### Testing

```shell
# lint, unit test and visual-diff test
npm test

# lint only
npm run lint

# unit tests only
npm run test:headless

# debug or run a subset of local unit tests
# then navigate to `http://localhost:9876/debug.html`
npm run test:headless:watch
```

#### Note on Sauce Labs tests

Pull requests run cross-browser tests using Sauce. For troubleshooting,
see https://wiki.saucelabs.com/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=70072943.

### Visual Diff Testing

This repo uses the [@brightspace-ui/visual-diff utility](https://github.com/BrightspaceUI/visual-diff/) to compare current snapshots against a set of golden snapshots stored in source control.

```shell
# run visual-diff tests
npm run test:diff

# subset of visual-diff tests:
npm run test:diff -- -g some-pattern

# update visual-diff goldens
npm run test:diff:golden
```

Golden snapshots in source control must be updated by Travis CI. To trigger an update, press the "Regenerate Goldens" button in the pull request `visual-difference` test run.

## Versioning, Releasing & Deploying

All version changes should obey [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) rules.

Include either `[increment major]`, `[increment minor]` or `[increment patch]` in your merge commit message to automatically increment the `package.json` version and create a tag.

## Telemetry

This app gathers performance and usage telemetry. You can find more details [here](https://desire2learn.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DRACO/pages/1697317280/Engagement+Dashboard+Telemetry)
